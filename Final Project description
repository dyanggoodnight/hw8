idea 1:
A system which control by the magnet.
1) A maze made by wood
2) metal ball on top of the wood(in the maze)
3) magnet moving under the wood which control by the arduino system
4) magnet will let the metal moving from start point of the maze to the end point.
5) people can't see the magnet and arduino, so they don't know how does the metal ball moving.

idea 2:
Led Lighting system

idea 3:
Use arduino to paint watercolor, using arduino to mix different color and drop the color onto the drawing board.
